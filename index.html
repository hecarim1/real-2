            Grace Hopper was a pioneering American computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. She was born on December 9, 1906, and passed away on January 1, 1992.Grace Brewster Murray Hopper was born on the 9th of December in 1906, Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania. She grew up with great interest in mathematics and science, leading to her studying math and physics at Vassar college. Upon graduating in 1928 she moved to New York to pursue a career in finance but eventually shifted to mathematics.

        <div class="content">
            Hopper earned her master's in mathematics from Yale in 1934. She then joined the US Navy as a mathematician and later became an officer. During the Second World War, she was part of the naval reserve and worked on codebreaking at the Navy’s cryptanalysis department.

        <div class="subtitle">Contributions</div>
        <div class="content">
            she was a leading figure in the development of early high-level programming languages, notably the business language COBOL. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, one of the first high-level programming languages.

            Hopper made several breakthroughs in computer science such as COBOL and the development of naval computer systems. Hopper led the development of COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language), a high-level programming language that made programming and data processing simpler and more efficient. COBOL became one of the most used languages for programming in the 1960s. She was also involved in designing and developing several computing systems, such as the UNIVAC and the SMS for the Navy. Further, she popularized the concept of debugging, famously using a moth caught in the Harvard Mark 2 computer to further her point.

        <div class="subtitle">Legacy and Recognition</div>
        <div class="content">
            Hopper received numerous awards and honors for her contributions to the field of computing. She first received the Enrico Fermi Award in 1966, recognizing her outstanding contributions to the development of nuclear energy. She then received the Computer Society’s Turing Award in 1973, considered the highest honor in computer science, for her work in COBOL and debugging. She finally got promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral, becoming one of the first women to achieve this role.She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously by President Barack Obama on November 22, 2016.

        <div class="content">
            Hopper’s work greatly inspired future generations in technology. Being one of the first successful women in the field of STEM, she motivated many young women to pursue careers in science and technology.Grace Hopper's legacy continues to inspire and influence contemporary computer scientists and technologists. The annual Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing conference is named in her honor, and it's the world's largest gathering of women in computing.
